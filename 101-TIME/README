Windows and Linux store their time in the UEFI firmware differently. This can cause the clock to become de-synchronized when you switch from one OS to the other.

timedatectl set-local-rtc 1 --adjust-system-clock
timedatectl

You should see RTC in local TZ: yes in the output. If you need to revert this setting, turn it back off with this command:

timedatectl set-local-rtc 0 --adjust-system-clock
